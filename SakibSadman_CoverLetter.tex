I am writing to express my interest in the position of \textbf{Junior System Engineer} at your organization. As a final-year \textbf{B.Sc. Computer Science student at BRAC University (CGPA 3.74/4.00)}, with hands-on experience in \textbf{system administration, scripting, and IT infrastructure}, I am eager to apply my skills and grow in a professional environment.

Through my personal projects, I have gained practical experience in configuring and managing \textbf{Linux environments, servers, Docker containers, and SQL databases}. I developed automation scripts in \textbf{Bash} for system setup (such as Docker installation) and worked on \textbf{laravel and Spring Boot applications} deployed on servers. These projects reflect both my technical ability and my problem-solving mindset.

In addition, I hold the \textbf{Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate}, which has strengthened my understanding of IT security, backup strategies, and system hardening skills highly relevant to managing and protecting IT infrastructure. My contribution to \textbf{OpenTelemetry} documentation translation also demonstrates my collaborative spirit and interest in modern observability tools.

I am particularly drawn to this role because it offers the opportunity to work closely with senior engineers on \textbf{virtualization, storage, and cloud technologies} areas where I am eager to deepen my expertise. With a strong foundation in \textbf{Linux/Windows systems, networking concepts, and scripting}, I am confident I can assist in maintaining reliable systems while learning and adapting quickly to new technologies.

Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my academic background, technical skills, and enthusiasm for IT infrastructure align with the goals of your team.
